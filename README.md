# Summary
This repo contains solutions to over 1400 problems from [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/problemset/ "leetcode") (in 3 languages):
* C++ (over **1300** solutions)
* Javascript (**39** solutions)
* MySQL (**74** solutions)

---

## Some points to be noted
* A problem can have multiple solutions, marked with [1], [2], [3], ... at the end. Generally, higher number indicates more efficient solution.
* Partially accepted solutions are marked with **[TLE]** or **[MLE]** in their title, representing Time Limit Exceeded and Memory Limit Exceeded respectively.
* Most solutions have Time and Space Complexity mentioned as **T.C.=O()** and **S.C.=O()** respectively.
* The C++ directory is split into 7 parts (with a range of 500 each): [1-500], [501-1000], ..., [3001-3500]. This is done to overcome the limitation of github webview only allowing a max of 1000 files to be displayed in a directory.
* There are no problems with solutions in different languages, except problems [**539, 1154, 1507, 3280**] (which have solutions in both C++ and Javascript).
