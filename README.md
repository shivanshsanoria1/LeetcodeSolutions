## Some points to be noted

-   A problem can have multiple solutions, marked with [1], [2], [3], ... at the end. Generally, higher number indicates more efficient or less intuitive solution.
-   Partially accepted solutions are marked with **[TLE]** or **[MLE]** in their title, representing 'Time Limit Exceeded' and 'Memory Limit Exceeded' respectively.
-   Most solutions have Time and Space Complexity mentioned as **T.C.=O()** and **S.C.=O()** respectively.
-   A list of all algorithms can be found in '[this csv file](./algorithms/metadata/algorithms_metadata.csv)'.
-   There are some problems with solutions in multiple languages (C++ and Javascript).
-   The C++ directory is split into 8 parts (with a range of 500 each): [0001-0500], [0501-1000], ..., [3501-4000]. This is done to overcome the limitation of github webview only allowing a max of 1000 files to be displayed in a directory.
