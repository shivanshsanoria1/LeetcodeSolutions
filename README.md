# Summary
This repo contains the solutions to various problems from [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/problemset/ "leetcode") (in 3 languages):

* Javascript (**35** solutions)
* MySQL (**73** solutions)

## Some points to be noted
* A problem can have multiple solutions, marked with [1], [2], [3], ... at the end. Generally, higher number indicates more efficient solution.
* Partially accepted solutions are marked with **[TLE]** or **[MLE]** in their name, representing Time Limit Exceeded and Memory Limit Exceeded respectively.
* Most solutions have Time and Space Complexity mentioned as **T.C.=O()** and **S.C.=O()** respectively.
* The C++ directory is split into 7 parts (with a range of 500 each): [1-500], [501-1000], ..., [3001-3500]. This done to overcome the limitation of github webview only allowing a max of 1000 files to be displayed.
* There are no problems with solutions in different languages, except problem **1154** (which has solutions in C++ and Javascript).
