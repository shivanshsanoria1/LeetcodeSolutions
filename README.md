* Javascript (over **65** solutions)
* MySQL (over **75** solutions)

## Some points to be noted
* A problem can have multiple solutions, marked with [1], [2], [3], ... at the end. Generally, higher number indicates more efficient or less intuitive solution.
* Partially accepted solutions are marked with **[TLE]** or **[MLE]** in their title, representing 'Time Limit Exceeded' and 'Memory Limit Exceeded' respectively.
* Most solutions have Time and Space Complexity mentioned as **T.C.=O()** and **S.C.=O()** respectively.
* A list of all the Leetcode solutions present in this repo can be found in '[this csv file](./stats/generated/leetcode-stats.csv)'.
* A list of all algorithms can be found in '[this csv file](./algorithms/metadata/algorithms_metadata.csv)'.
* There are some problems with solutions in multiple languages (C++ and Javascript).
* The C++ directory is split into 8 parts (with a range of 500 each): [0001-0500], [0501-1000], ..., [3501-4000]. This is done to overcome the limitation of github webview only allowing a max of 1000 files to be displayed in a directory.
